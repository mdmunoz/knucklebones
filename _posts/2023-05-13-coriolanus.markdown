Petitioning obsequious amends,  
Vernacular administrators tempt  
Ignoble constitutions to pretend  
Hypocrisy ameliorates contempt.  
  
Unmotivated even to exempt,  
Incarnadine with lapidary flensing,  
A warrior habitually unkempt  
In sallies of exculpatory fencing—  
  
Incarnating instead of representing  
The body of indomitable Rome—  
Sedately occupied with acquiescing,  
They bore anemic warrens through a home  
  
Factitiously preoccupied by wounds  
More fittingly exhibited in tombs.
