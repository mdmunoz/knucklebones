Be careful with your studies, child.  
The truth is dark and deep,  
And notions from its secret wilds  
Pursue you into sleep.  
The countlessness of numbering  
Seems innocent by day,  
But in forgotten slumbering  
The distance falls away  
Between you and that timeless dawn  
Whose creatures laugh and leap,  
Inviting you to wake beyond  
Infinities of sheep.
