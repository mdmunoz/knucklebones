Raccoon Raccoon, your shadow  
Across the twilit mallow  
Was forecast by invention:  
Who envisioned your dimensions?  
  
Where is your ashen center  
Disturbed to stoke its embers?  
Whose elegance there lingers?  
What scalpels carved those fingers?  
  
What subterfuge previsioned  
Stealth and ringed your tail with ribbons?  
When that tail began its swishing  
What prodigies of stitching  
  
Or origami sprinked  
Its ruling brain with wrinkles?  
What rascally connivance  
Surpassed poetic license  
  
When first volcanoes clouded  
Horizons? Who was shrouded  
And who, exposed, discovered  
Their true faces to each other?  
  
Raccoon Raccoon, your shadow  
Across the twilit mallow  
Was forecast by invention:  
Who envisioned your dimensions?
