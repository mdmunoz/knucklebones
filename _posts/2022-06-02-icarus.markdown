A plowhorse draws the peasant’s pleated furrows,  
Infringing on a forest’s leafy arbors  
Above the distant beaches’ placid boroughs  
Encircling the coastal crescent’s harbors.  
Pale mountains grow proportionately darker,  
In incrementally distinctive hues,  
As distances stretch staggeringly farther:  
Empyrean purples and pearlescent blues.  
A shepherd slouches on his staff to muse  
Amid his foraging, pacific flock.  
An angler’s assiduity eschews  
The roiling emerald sea beneath the rocks,  
And Icarus, convulsing in the spray.  
Slow breezes bear untroubled ships away.
